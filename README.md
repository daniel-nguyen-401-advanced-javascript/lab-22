## Challenge
    
You will not be creating any application functionality in this lab. Instead, you will be just writing unit tests, adding styling, and deploying. The application code you will be working with is located in the /starter-code directory, and is a simple counter akin to what you may have created in Lab 21.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Structured the Header, Counter, and Footer together in the App file. Then rendered the App file in the Index file. 

# API
