## Challenge
    
You will not be creating any application functionality in this lab. Instead, you will be just writing unit tests, adding styling, and deploying. The application code you will be working with is located in the /starter-code directory, and is a simple counter akin to what you may have created in Lab 21.

## Approach & Efficiency

- First I did some styling. Then I got the tests hooked up. I got a little tripped up on targeting the clicked element but that wasn't too crazy. Then I followed the provided deployment videos and that was it! This lab wasn't too bad. 

# API

- n/a
